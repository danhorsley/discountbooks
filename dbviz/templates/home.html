        <p> It is amazing how much stuff you accumulate over the years without noticing.</p>
        <p>When packing up to move house in mid 2020 my wife and I realised we had a mountain of unwanted possessions.  
            Being as ruthless and as unsentimental as we could we listed hundreds of items on Ebay.  
            Bulky furniture, forgotten toys, ancient musical equipment and hundreds of books.  
            To our astonishment almost all the items sold for the asking price and sold fast.
            The books were the best items. Many of them had only decorated our bookshelves for years and we were never going to read them again.  
            Also they are small, almost indestructible in the post and sell for a good percentage of the original price.
            I got to thinking that other people would have unwanted books on a much larger scale.  
            And one could sell those books in a place where people actually bought books : Amazon.
        </p>
        <p>   A search of Google showed there were several specialist wholesalers for 'overstocked' books.
            Amazon had on every item page a helpful sales rank number (ASR), number of competing offers and a price.  
            I started ploughing through the vast catalogues of books to see if anything was worth buying.  
            The targets were a low ASR, a low number of competing offers and a high margin (see chart below).

            {{ html_plot1|safe }}
        </div>
        <p>The first few hundred I compiled by hand on a spreadsheet to get a feel for things.  
            Later on I automated a process to scrape the catalogues from the wholesalers 
            and pick up data from a cheap commerical source.  
            My first order was 48 names from a heavily discounted catalogue of over 1500 names.  
            Though this was in December last year some of these names I have still not sold today.  
            Indeed some I have never even sold a single copy.  
            Yet the successes more than paid for all the disasters
